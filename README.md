# AppDevExamples

Examples included are not complete programs, as proprietary information has been ommitted. These examples serve as a showcase of my programming ability. A brief description of each project has been included below:

Example_API_JSON - Java - This code currently acts as an API for other Java programs to interface with the Automation Control rooms. There are two public methods: MonitorBot and DeployBot. Monitor bot returns the status and progress of the bot that matches the supplied run id. Deploy bot tells the control room to deploy a bot of the specified type. This method returns whether this was successful or not.
